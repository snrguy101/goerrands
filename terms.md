7. ORDERING AND CANCELLING PERSONAL SERVICES
7.1. If you order a personal service and the technician has agreed to undertake the work then the personal service is considered to be ordered.

7.2. Once a technician confirms that he/she will undertake a service the user enters into a separate agreement with the technician for intricacies or specifications regarding the provision of the particular service on such terms and conditions as the user agrees with the technician. GoErrands does not provide personal services and is not a party in this regard to the terms of a user's agreement with the relevant technician.

7.3. Canceling the use of an ordered personal service is considered to be the situation where he technician has replied to a user's booking request and the user subsequently rejects, cancels or refuses the personal service. When a personal service booking request is cancelled after a certain time period the user will be required to pay a cancellation fee.

7.4. If a user cancels a personal service request on multiple successive instances within a 24-hour period, we may temporarily block the user's account as a warning measure. After the issuance of multiple such warnings, we may suspend the user's account for a longer period (e.g.: one (1) month). After that period a user may request an account reactivation and such application will be reviewed by GoErrands.

7.5. It is the duty of a user or a person for whom a personal service is ordered to make themselves available at the time specified in the booking request. This time may be modified as agreed between the user and the technician When a technician notifies the user about their arrival to the user's destination or desired location for rendering the service, and the user or person for whom the personal service is ordered is not at the said destination or location chosen for rendering the service not within the time period as specified in the booking request or any subsequent modified time in the user's agreement with the technician, after multiple requests for availability is made by the technician within a one-hour time-window and said user or person for whom the service is ordered does not make himself/herself available, the personal service ordered will be deemed cancelled and the user will not be issued a refund. Please note that GoErrands is not responsible for such situations.

7.6. Once the technician arrives at the destination or desired location for rendering the service, and sends the user a notification that he/she has arrived the GoErrands app may begin charging fare on a waiting time basis according to the rates specified in the GoErrands app.

7.7. If a user has requested personal services using the GoErrands app and causes damage to any of the technician's tools in the course of rendering the personal service, the technician reserves the right to require compensation for the damage. If the user does not compensate for the damage, GoErrands may, in its discretion and where feasible, pursue the claims on behalf of the provider of the personal service.

8. PAYMENTS
8.1. 8.1.Users have the option to pay the charges for the personal services either directly to the technician or via the In-app Payment.

8.2. Cash Payment Option

8.2.1. The GoErrands App offers a cash payment option for users upon completion of a personal service. The cash payment option is available to all registered users subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this clause.

8.2.2. Where the User chooses to exercise this option as a preferred payment method, they shall ensure that they have sufficient cash to offset the payment charged as displayed on the App.

8.2.3. Where the User pays the technician the charges directly, it is the technician's obligation to collect the charges and remit GoErrands's commission.

8.2.4. Upon receipt of the charges from users exercising the cash payment option, it is a requisite for professional service providers/technicians to ensure remittance of GoErrands's commission (percentage of which is disclosed to professional service providers/technicians upon sign up). Failure to remit GoErrands's commission within fourteen (14) days, in this regard, shall lead to a suspension of the professional service provider/technician's account until such time that the commission is remitted. Additionally, and/or alternatively, GoErrands reserves a right to a lien over any subsequent payments to offset or discharge any debt owed by a professional service provider/technician.

8.2.5. In circumstances where the user outrightly fails or refuses to pay the charges as displayed on the App, or is unwilling to pay the full charges as displayed on the App after the completion of a personal service, GoErrands will send a notice of debt to the user on the technician's behalf. Such authorisation derives from the mandate of paying agent given to GoErrands and does not entail that GoErrands has an obligation to compensate the charges not outrightly paid or not paid in full by the user. Where the personal service completed was not booked by the recipient of the personal service and the said recipient does not agree to pay the charge for the provision of the personal service, the charge will be paid by the registered user who booked the provision of the personal Service.

In either event, failure to pay charges upon completion of a personal service(s) will lead to a suspension of the registered user's account.

8.2.6. In the event GoErrands, in its discretion, pays relevant amounts to the technician on a user's behalf (e.g. and not exclusively the cancellation fee), the technician’s claim against the user shall be deemed to have transferred from the respective technician to GoErrands, and the user shall be deemed to have debt incurred against GoErrands and GoErrands may use any legal means available to recover the debt including but not limited to litigation. In addition, the defaulting user shall equally be responsible for any costs incurred in the process of recovering the debt.

8.3. In-App Payment Option

8.3.1. Users can pay for the personal services desired and/or rendered with a card and other payment methods (e.g.: GoErrands Wallet), which require prior activation in the GoErrands app. By providing GoErrands in-app Payment service, GoErrands acts as a commercial agent for the providers of personal services. A user's obligation to the provider of the personal service will be fulfilled when the payment order is given to transfer funds to GoErrands's bank account. A user is responsible for ensuring that the payment takes place and ensuring that sufficient funds are available in their payment instruments. If your primary payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, users agree that GoErrands may, as the professional service provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in a user's account, if available.

8.3.2. When making payments through GoErrands in-App Payment, GoErrands receives your payments and forwards the money to the technician. GoErrands may ask for additional data from users to verify payment methods.

8.3.3. Where it proves improbable, or impossible to charge a user's payment instrument for a personal service(s) rendered, such improbability or impossibility will lead to a suspension of the user's account.

8.3.4. In circumstances where GoErrands pays relevant amounts to the technician on a user's behalf (e.g. and not exclusively the cancellation fee), the technician’s claim against the user shall be deemed to have transferred from the respective technician to GoErrands, and the user shall be deemed to have debt incurred against GoErrands and GoErrands may use any legal means available to recover the debt including but not limited to litigation. In addition, the defaulting user shall equally be responsible for any costs incurred in the process of recovering the debt.

8.3.5. When making payments by GoErrands in-App Payment for personal services, GoErrands bears no responsibility for possible third-party payment costs (mobile operators, bank fees etc.). These service providers may charge you additional fees when processing payments in connection with the GoErrands in-App Payment. GoErrands is not responsible for any such fees and disclaims all liability in this regard. Your payment method may also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by the applicable third-party payment service provider; please review these terms and conditions before using your payment method.

8.3.6. GoErrands is responsible for the functioning of GoErrands in-app Payment and will provide support in resolving problems where necessary. The resolution of disputes related to GoErrands in-App Payment also takes place through us. For payment support services please contact: GoErrandslimited@gmail.com.

8.3.7. All charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by GoErrands using the preferred payment method designated in a user's Account, after which GoErrands provide a receipt. Users must pay for services in full before the service is rendered, and cancellations must be made according to the cancellation policy.

9.1. As GoErrands is not a provider or broker of personal services, any issues with defects or quality of the personal services rendered will be reviewed and resolved in light of representations and warranties made by the personal service provider or in accordance with industry standards of the relevant public authority.

9.2.

9.4. Professional service providers are required to maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, good manners and proper decorum. Professional service providers should at all times be mindful of their positions as professionals and deliver services with the highest degree of expertise, skill and business ethics applicable to providing such services and endeavour to perform the User's request in the best interest of the User. GoErrands will make every effort to ensure that only technicians, who have integrity and are respectful of their profession and consumers, use the GoErrands app. However, we are in no position to guarantee that every provider of personal services, located by the GoErrands app, satisfies the aforementioned criteria at all times. If a user experiences objectionable personal service, please notify the business name or company responsible for the professional service provider(where the technician is affiliated to one), a law enforcement authority or our customer support for decisive action.

9.5. Neither users nor professional service providers shall use GoErrands Services or Platform to generate, express or promote content that:

If GoErrands will not be able to verify the identity of a user or professional service provider, the GoErrands Service may be suspended for such user or professional service provider until the verification process is completed.

9.7. To fulfil legal and compliance requirements, GoErrands has the right to use technical means to review the behaviour and information of users and professional service providers utilising GoErrands Services, including but not limited to reviewing In-app chats and creating databases for illegal content features.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, AND INDEMNITY
11.1. As the GoErrands app is an information society service (a means of communication) between users and technicians, we cannot guarantee or take any responsibility for the quality or defects in the provision of personal services. We will take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, images and descriptions of personal services are correct at the time that the information is first uploaded to the GoErrands App by professional service providers. As the usage of the GoErrands app for requesting personal services depends on the behaviour of the technicians, GoErrands does not guarantee that users will always have offers available for the provision of personal services.

11.2. The GoErrands app does not offer or broker personal services for users. It is also not a service soliciting agency for finding users for professional service providers. The GoErrands app is used as the means for organising the provision of personal services.
